### Project Purpose üìç
This is a software application that facilitates communication and collaboration between teachers and parents to monitor student performance. Teachers can add students to their classes and upload stories in the form of videos or pictures to update parents on classroom activities. They can also award points to students, and parents can give points to their children as well. Students can complete assignments and draw, and parents can upload their own stories. The application allows parents to monitor their child's progress and stay involved in their education.
